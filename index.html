                App Inventor's block-based programming approach reminds me of
                Scratch, which I teach to elementary students. I've witnessed
                firsthand how visual programming impacts young learners. Though
                I've never contributed to open source before, this is a perfect
                opportunity to combine my technical skills with my passion for
                making coding accessible to beginners.

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                I teach programming to middle school students using HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, and Python. I also teach Scratch to elementary
                school students. Working with young learners has shown me how
                the right introduction to programming can spark lifelong
                interest in technology. I'm passionate about introductory
                programming because I've seen students' excitement when they
                create their first interactive project or solve a challenging
                problem with code. As a Teaching Assistant at Correlation One
                and Stack Education, I've guided adult beginners through web
                development concepts with personalized coaching. These diverse
                teaching experiences have given me insight into how different
                learners approach programming concepts, and I'm interested in
                tools like App Inventor that make coding accessible to beginners
                of all ages.

              <p class="paragraph-4">
                In my role at American Family Insurance, I worked heavily with
                JavaScript for over three years. I built sales platforms using
                React and TypeScript, created experimental features, and
                connected our front-end to various APIs. I also refactored older
                JavaScript code and helped launch new products ahead of
                schedule. Beyond my professional work, I've taught JavaScript to
                my middle school students and helped adult learners grasp
                JavaScript concepts as a teaching assistant. I'm comfortable
                with the entire JavaScript ecosystem, whether I'm working with
                vanilla JS, modern frameworks, testing tools, or build systems.

                I also developed backend microservices using Java and Spring
                Boot to support our mobile OCR feature, while also contributing
                Kotlin code for the Android implementation. I architected
                RESTful APIs that processed document images captured through the
                mobile app, implemented service layers that coordinated with AWS
                recognition services, and created data models to store and
                retrieve extracted information. On the Android side, I leveraged
                Kotlin's concise syntax and null safety features to build robust
                mobile components that interfaced with our backend services. By
                using Spring Boot's dependency injection on the server side and
                Kotlin's coroutines for asynchronous operations on Android, I
                created a seamless end-to-end solution. This project
                significantly improved customer experience by allowing users to
                quickly scan and process insurance documents through their
                mobile devices. Please note I do not have samples for
                Java/Android development because this work belongs to American
                Family.

                Throughout my software engineering career, I've used Git
                extensively for version control and collaboration. At American
                Family Insurance, I managed code across multiple repositories,
                worked with feature branches, and resolved merge conflicts in
                our team's workflow. I have experience with GitLab CI/CD
                pipelines for automated testing and deployment. I'm comfortable
                with common Git operations like rebasing, cherry-picking, and
                reverting changes. I've also helped onboard new team members to
                Git workflows and established best practices for commit messages
                and branch management.

                I've been actively involved with Resilient Coders, a software
                community in Boston and Philly, where I teamed up with people in
                the community to build

                  program.</a
                >
                We coordinated through Slack and Google Meet, each putting in
                about 5 hours weekly for several months. The project had a
                proper git workflow where we created feature branches, submitted
                PRs, and conducted code reviews before merging to main. We built
                it using React, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I personally led the
                development of the conversation history feature and implemented
                the dark mode toggle. I also wrote unit tests using Jest and
                created comprehensive documentation to help future contributors
                understand the codebase. What made this experience valuable was
                learning to collaborate asynchronously with developers of
                varying experience levels, some of whom were recent graduates of
                the program. Right now,

                using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. We're applying lessons
                learned from the chatbot project, with more emphasis on planning
                and architecture before diving into code. These projects have
                really shown me how to work effectively with remote teams using
                today's collaboration tools. <br /><br />
                During my time at American Family Insurance, I worked on their
                flagship application, which was a massive monorepo with hundreds
                of thousands of lines of code built with React, Redux, and
                TypeScript. We had daily standups with a team of 12 developers
                and bi-weekly sprint planning and retrospectives following agile
                methodologies. I helped convert legacy code to TypeScript and
                integrate it into the main app, which included refactoring
                complex state management patterns and ensuring backward
                compatibility. This effort got our new product out two months
                early and reduced reported bugs by 30%. <br />
                <br />I worked side by side with our UX designers and marketing
                teams in weekly sync meetings to make sure everything we built
                matched the Figma designs perfectly. One of my main
                contributions was implementing a component library that
                standardized UI elements across the platform, which
                significantly reduced development time for new features. I also
                got to implement A/B testing with Optimizely, connect
                third-party APIs with OAuth authentication, and build the
                company's first AI quote assistant using AWS Lex, which boosted
                customer quotes by 15%. This required coordination across four
                different teams including data science, design, and product.
                Being part of the urgent issues team taught me a lot about
                diagnosing problems in production using Datadog and
                communicating with support staff and coordinating fixes across
                different dev teams under tight deadlines. Working in such a
                large system meant I had to stay on top of code quality through
                code reviews, security issues with SonarQube scans, and
                deployment processes with Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD pipelines
                that included staging environments and smoke tests before
                production releases.
