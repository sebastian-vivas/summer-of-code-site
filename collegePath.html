          <p class="paragraph-6">Applying to college is an exciting yet stressful time for high school seniors. I want
            to create a mobile app that provides students all the help they need when applying to college.</p>
          <br>
          <div id="problem" class="subgroup">
            <h4 class="heading-8">The Problem</h4>
            <p class="paragraph-4"> For many high school seniors, the idea of heading off to college can be exciting.
              However, the application process to get there can be overwhelming, complicated and frustrating for
              students. Students need keep track of important deadlines,
              complete numerous application forms and essays, and make some hard decisions along the way.
              <br><br>Further, high school students are expected to do a lot of research on their own when navigating
              the college application process. While guidance counselors can and should be a resource for students,<span
                class="text-span-9"> the nationwide average ratio of high school guidance counselors
                to students is 310:1.</span> This can make it difficult for high school students to get the help they
              need when they need it.
              <br><br> In spite of this, many students seek guidance from their parents or other family members that
              have been through the college application process themselves. First-generation students, however, are the
              first in their families to apply to college and don’t have family members familiar with the postsecondary
              education system. <span class="text-span-9">Without experienced parents or other family
                members to help with the college application process, many first-generation students feel like they need
                to figure things out on their own.</span> This can cause many first-generation students to feel
              overwhelmed
              by the college application process.

              <p class="paragraph-9"> In November
                2020, the Common Application, a tool used nationwide by students to apply to both public and private
                institutions, reported declines of 8 percent in the amount of applications submitted. <span
                  class="text-span-9">Applications for first-generation students and those eligible
                  for fee waivers are down 16 percent.</span> Many theorize that this is because <span

                  financial impact.</span>
                <br><br> I also conducted research on potential features to include in my app. A feature I’m interested
                in adding to the CollegePath app is <span class="text-span-9">a timeline that shows
                  users at a glance college application related tasks to complete throughout the year.</span> I explored
                recommended college application timelines for high school seniors and found these examples: <a

                rising high school seniors throughout the college application process. It was somewhat difficult to find
                direct competitors because there are only a few apps with personalized college counseling as its primary
                focus. I realized that, <span class="text-span-9">due to the nuance behind every
                  student’s college application, college counseling exists as an in-person service in either schools,
                  non-profit organizations or as a private college counseling service.</span>
                <br><br> I found two apps with elements of personalized college counseling: Pointer and College Prep.
                These apps help high school seniors find resources and keep track of important dates.</p>

              these questions are throughout the college application process, I thought about how these questions,
              without inclusive answers, might cause a <span class="text-span-9">sense of fatigue and
                frustration for users.</span> I didn't want my onboarding process for this app to contribute to those
              negative feelings. So I conducted research on how to make these questions more inclusive.
              <br><br>My research showed that three ways to make race/ethnicity and gender identity questions more
              inclusive:
            </p>
            <ul role="list" class="list-2">
              <li class="list-item"><span class="text-span-9">An option for users to enter their own
                  specification to the question,</span> in case an answer relevant to them is not listed.</li>
              <li class="list-item-2"><span class="text-span-9">The ability for users to select
                  multiple options.</span> Racial/ethnic identity, as well as gender identity, is complex, and the
                ability to select multiple answers can help users answer these questions in a way that feels more true
                to their identity.</li>
              <li class="list-item-3"><span class="text-span-9">An explanation why this information is
                  being gathered,</span> along with <span class="text-span-9">an option to opt out of

              CollegePath. I wanted a simple name that clearly indicates that the app helps students find a 'path' to
              college that is both accessible and straightforward.<br><br><span class="text-span-9">To
                counteract the stress associated with the college application process, I designed CollegePath’s brand as
                warm, friendly and inviting.</span> I also found that many sites associated with the college application
              process don’t use much color. Because of that, I used shades of yellow, red, green and blue as brand
              colors but maintained a muted color palette so it wouldn’t be too overwhelming (or too flashy) for users.

              <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
              <p class="paragraph-25">To test my prototype, I recruited 4 participants:<span
                  class="text-span-9"> three high school seniors who just completed the college
                  application process, and one current college sophomore.</span> All participants are the first in their
                family to go to college.
                <br><br>My objectives for usability testing were:</p>
              <ul role="list" class="list-2">
                <li class="list-item">Determine if the sign up and onboarding process is comprehensive enough for users
                  to create a robust user profile, without being too overwhelming.</li>
                <li class="list-item-2">Determine if the homepage of the app provides information users need at a glance
                  when they first open the app.</li>
                <li class="list-item-3">Determine if users are able to find the resources they need on the app.</li>
                <li class="list-item-3">Understand how users feel about the Application Checklist feature and see what
                  pain points exist.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="paragraph-25"> I received a lot of positive feedback from participants about the design of the
                app and how information was organized. <span class="text-span-9">All participants said
                  they wished they were able to use an app like this when they were applying for college, especially as
                  first-generation students.</span> This feedback was great to hear and really demonstrated the value of
                an app.
                <br><br>Some notable comments were:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="block-quote"><span class="text-span-12">&quot;</span> <em>I think this app has a lot of
                  value because it's carefully curated and not overwhelming. You can tell you guys are very intentional
                  with what you're doing, which is a positive for me. I would choose you over CollegeBoard. </em><span
                  class="text-span-13"><em>&quot;</em></span></blockquote>
              <blockquote class="block-quote"><span class="text-span-12">&quot;</span> <em>This is a great resource,
                  especially for kids that are first-generation and don’t have access to this information. Adults say to
                  reach out guidance counselors but in a pandemic, that wasn’t easy </em><span
                  class="text-span-13"><em>&quot;</em></span></blockquote>
              <blockquote class="block-quote"><span class="text-span-12">&quot;</span> <em>I think it's really
                  convenient. Instead of looking at the Common Application portal, I’d rather look at this. It’s a
                  hassle to open a new webpage on the Common Application site then check deadlines for schools
                  individually. Here, everything is in one place. </em><span class="text-span-13"><em>&quot;</em></span>

              <br><br>
              <p class="paragraph-25"> There was still some areas of concern though. <span
                  class="text-span-9">When testing the Application Checklist feature, all participants
                  had trouble marking a task as complete. </span>All participants immediately clicked the plus sign,
                instead of the correct action: clicking on the task itself. The feedback I received for this feature was
                that <span class="text-span-9">when users hear ‘Checklist’, they assume there will be
                  checkboxes.</span> When they did not see a checkbox, they assumed that the plus sign would act the
                same way as a checkbox.
                <br><br>Another comment that came up was that during the onboarding process, there isn't an option for
                users to opt out when asked questions about test scores and GPAs. Some users might not have this
                information readily available and have to come back to these questions later.

              handful of suggestions on features users would want to see from the CollegePath app. I wanted to map out

            <h4>Final Iterations</h4>
            <p class="paragraph-27">I made changes to the application checklist page, primarily by adding checkboxes
              instead of a plus sign. I also removed directions because it seemed as though users intuitively know to click
              the checkbox to mark a task as complete.

            especially difficult for first-generation students marginalized by the higher education system. As a former first-generation college student and a former college counselor for other
            first-generation college students, I feel very strongly about making college accessible to all people. It felt really fulfilling
            to combine my knowledge and passion for college access to design an app that I know would help students in a
            very tangible way. </p>
